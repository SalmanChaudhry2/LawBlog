## Featured Article: **Celebrity Estate Plans Series (Part 3 of 4)** — Jay Leno’s Case and the Crucial Need for Incapacity Planning  

Over the past two weeks, we’ve explored how celebrities have approached estate planning, particularly in relation to death. This week, we shift focus to an equally critical but often overlooked aspect — **incapacity planning**. Unlike death, not everyone experiences incapacity, but it’s something that can strike at any age due to accidents, illnesses, or aging-related conditions like dementia. Unfortunately, as Jay Leno’s court battle highlights, the consequences of failing to plan in advance can be costly, stressful, and deeply personal.  

### **What Is Incapacity and Why Does It Matter?**  

Incapacity refers to losing the ability to make sound **financial**, **medical**, or **legal decisions** for yourself. Whether caused by a tragic accident, dementia, or a serious illness, incapacity often leaves loved ones scrambling to manage your affairs. And here’s the critical point: incapacity occurs while you’re still alive, meaning the plans you make now must address transitions from health to incapacity and eventually to death.  

Key considerations include:  

- **Timing matters**: Incapacity planning documents, such as a Power of Attorney, are nullified upon death. Separate documents are needed for post-death planning.  
- **Power of Attorney limitations**: Many people mistakenly believe that authority granted under a Power of Attorney continues after death. It doesn’t. Without proper planning, loved ones may face court battles and delays to access assets.  
- **A seamless transition**: To avoid court and conflict, incapacity plans should integrate smoothly with post-death plans, ensuring ease for family members.

### **Jay Leno’s Court Case: Insights for Everyone**  

Jay Leno’s wife, Mavis, has been battling dementia, rendering her unable to manage her financial affairs. Despite being married for over 40 years, Jay had to take the legal route — filing a lawsuit — to gain control of her accounts and finances. After months of court proceedings, Jay was granted the authority he needed.  

Here are the **key lessons** from the Leno case:  

- **Marriage doesn’t grant automatic authority**: If your spouse has separate assets, you won’t have automatic access to them. Advance planning is critical to avoid court battles.  
- **The court process is costly and time-consuming**: Without proper incapacity planning, anyone — even a spouse — must file legal actions to gain control of financial accounts, often at the expense of time and money.  
- **Conflict can delay resolution**: While Jay and Mavis’s case was straightforward due to their longstanding marriage, complications often arise in blended families or with other relatives who may contest decisions.  
- **Public exposure is inevitable**: Court proceedings are public records, revealing personal and financial details. This can expose vulnerable individuals to scams and unwanted attention.
